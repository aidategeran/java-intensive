-Create a simple Java program that simulates a Library Management System. This program will allow you to:
-Store a list of books (using an ArrayList).
-Manage a list of borrowed books (using a HashSet, since borrowed books should be unique).
-Track book borrow requests in the order they are received (using a Deque).
-Keep track of how many copies of each book are available in the library (using a HashMap).

public class LibraryManagment {
//     keeps truck of how many books are available
    HashMap<String, Integer> availability = new HashMap<>();
